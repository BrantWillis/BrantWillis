I'm Brant Willis, a student learning to code.
I'm a second-year student at the University of Virginia studying Computer Engineering.
I'm interested in data analysis, DLD, and software.  
I have done work in C++, Python, and Java for class, and have worked with QGIS and GDScript on my own.  
I'm currently making a story-based RPG in Godot.
